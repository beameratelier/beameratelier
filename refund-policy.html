    Beamer Atelier provides downloadable digital products in the form of LaTeX
    Beamer themes and presentation design systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Digital Products</h3>

  <p>
    All products sold through this website are digital downloads. Upon successful
    purchase, customers receive immediate access to downloadable files.
  </p>

  <h3>No Right to Cancel After Download</h3>

  <p>
    Under the UK Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges)
    Regulations 2013, consumers normally have a 14-day right to cancel online purchases.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, this right does not apply to digital content supplied on a non-tangible
    medium once the download has begun, provided that the consumer:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Has given express consent for immediate delivery, and</li>
    <li>Acknowledges that they lose their right to cancel once the download begins.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By completing a purchase on this website, you consent to immediate delivery
    of the digital product and acknowledge that you waive your 14-day statutory
    right to cancel once the download is made available.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Issues</h3>

  <p>
    If you experience a technical issue, receive a corrupted file, or encounter
    a genuine product defect, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:hello@beameratelier.com">hello@beameratelier.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will make reasonable efforts to resolve any issue promptly.
  </p>

  <h3>Discretionary Refunds</h3>

  <p>
    While refunds are generally not provided due to the nature of digital downloads,
    Beamer Atelier reserves the right to issue refunds at its sole discretion in
    exceptional circumstances.
